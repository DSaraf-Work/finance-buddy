## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No emails fetched
**Check:**
1. Are there Gmail connections? `SELECT * FROM fb_gmail_connections;`
2. Are whitelisted senders configured? `SELECT * FROM fb_config WHERE config_key = 'WHITELISTED_SENDERS';`
3. Are there emails from whitelisted senders in Gmail?

### Issue: Processing fails
**Check:**
1. Email has required fields: `google_user_id`, `connection_id`
2. AI API keys are configured
3. Check logs for specific error messages

### Issue: Authentication required
**Solution:**
- Use test endpoint: `/api/test/admin-emails?action=<action>`
- Or log in to the app first

## 📝 Implementation Details

### Refresh Logic
1. For each Gmail connection:
   - Get last email timestamp from database
   - Subtract 1 hour (buffer to prevent missing emails)
   - Create date range: (last timestamp - 1 hour) to now
   - If range > 1 day, break into 1-day batches
   - For each batch:
     - Build Gmail query: `(from:sender1 OR from:sender2) after:timestamp before:timestamp`
     - Fetch emails from Gmail API
     - For each email:
       - Check if exists (by user_id, google_user_id, message_id)
       - If exists: update email, mark transactions as "REFRESHED"
       - If not: insert new email with status "Fetched"

### Process Logic
1. Count total fetched emails
2. Return immediately (fire-and-forget)
3. Background processing:
   - While fetched emails exist:
     - Fetch batch of 10 emails (status = "Fetched", ordered by date desc)
     - For each email sequentially:
       - Process with AI (EmailProcessor)
       - Extract transaction
       - Save to fb_extracted_transactions
       - Update email status to "Processed"
     - Repeat until no more fetched emails
